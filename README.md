The learning outcomes of this project are: 

Developing proficiency in Python programming language and its data analysis libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit.

Gaining experience in data preprocessing techniques such as handling missing values, outlier detection, and data normalization to prepare data for machine learning modeling.

Understanding and visualizing the data using EDA techniques such as boxplots, histograms, and scatter plots.

Learning and applying advanced machine learning techniques such as regression and classification to predict continuous and binary target variables, respectively.

Building and optimizing machine learning models using appropriate evaluation metrics and techniques such as cross-validation and grid search.

Experience in feature engineering techniques to create new informative representations of the data.

Developing a web application using the Streamlit module to showcase the machine learning models and make predictions on new data.

Understanding the challenges and best practices in the manufacturing domain and how machine learning can help solve them.
